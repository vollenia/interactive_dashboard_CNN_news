# interactive_dashboard_CNN_news
## Summary

The goal of this project is to analyze [previously collected data](https://github.com/vollenia/web_scraper-CNN_news) from the the CNN (Cable News Network) website for the year of 2021. While the [previously performed analysis](https://github.com/vollenia/data_analysis_CNN_news) delivered plots that could only be presented as a static image, this project is aimed at creating interactive plots and bundeling them together into a dashboard that can be viewed and interacted with in the browser.

Once again, the focus of this analysis lies not on the contents of the articles themselves but on the meta information of these articles and since there is no specific problem that needs to be solved, an exploratory analysis is performed. For this purpose the data has been re-collected on the 2nd of May, 2022 and reflects the state of the CNN website at this point in time, which deviates slightly from the state reflected [_previously_](https://github.com/vollenia/data_analysis_CNN_news).

The analysis is performed in Python 3.10.3 and presented in a Jupyter notebook format. The virtual environment needed to run the notebook can be re-created by using the included _requirements.txt_.
To view the interactve dashboard, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run _panel serve interactive_dashboard.ipynb_ from within the virtual environment.
